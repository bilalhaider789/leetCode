// A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

// Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

// You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

// You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

 

// Example 1:

// Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
// Output: 2
// Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.

const findPeakElement=(nums)=> {
    if(nums.length <=1)
        return 0;

    let left = 0, right = nums.length-1;

    while(left <=  right) {
        let mid = Math.floor((right-left)/2) + left;
        
        if(nums[mid] < nums[mid+1]){
            left = mid + 1;
        }else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }

    return left;
};
